               On your way in to Diagon Alley stop by this popular wizarding pub. Recommended are the pea soup (known to eat people but hasn't in some time) and the exploding lemonade!

               After a meal at the Leaky, why not stop for some dessert at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour? The Parlour is a small shop with places to sit down inside and a small outside area as well. Check out all the colorful ice cream and maybe order a chocolate-raspberry with chopped nuts!
